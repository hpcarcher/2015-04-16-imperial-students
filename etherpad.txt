================== DAY 1 =======================

GOOD MORNING! :) 


For user.name I would put your full name. In a collaborative framework this will allow other people to identify you. In git there is a blame command `git blame` which will tell you who has modified each line in the code. If you have a cryptic username I will not know who to blame/credit with changes (though it has your email too)


Github repository for next modules:

================== DAY 2 =======================

Hello everyone and welcome back!

Please start your day by doing a "git pull" on the 2015-04-16-Imperial-Students" repository.

Since you cloned the repository we have added material for todays modules as well as the slides used during the workshop. YOU WILL NEED THESE CHANGES FOR TODAY'S LESSONS!!

Also, bookmark the following page if you would like to refresh your memory or learn more about git:

Cheers!

TESTING module:

Come on people! (:)



Does it return sensible output for simple problems (e.g. cities on a line)?
Permutating distance matrix should give same result - does it?
So should we make up some data for which we know the answer and then try to see if it gives that answer?
check it exits sensibly(/quickly) on an empty problem (ie i accidentally give it a non existent file/list of citys/costs etc)
Check whether etha function returns correct values (test needs to return correct value on set of values for which answer is known)
Test that there are cities in the first place. (could store city names as list and check list length?)
Add some form of visual representation of the results so that human eye can spot patterns, errors, etc..

The output could be commented. E.g. I have no idea what "p" is. 

Add some kind of confidence limit as random number generation is giving different answers

Does the code work at extremes


Test that if the input data is really non-negative integer ad =< the number of cities.

If you do a git pull you will find make/MakeNotes.pdf which were the notes used for the lecture on make.

unit test ideas:
'average'
    - a know graph is initialized with a distance matrix
    - check that the average values are equal to a pre-calculated value
    - check what happens is a graph created with a mix of integer and float
'init'
    - check that a graph is created correctly for a given input
