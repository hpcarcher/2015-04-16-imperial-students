NAME
       git-add - Add file contents to the index

SYNOPSIS
       git add [--verbose | -v] [--dry-run | -n] [--force | -f] [--interactive | -i] [--patch | -p]
		 [--edit | -e] [--[no-]all | --[no-]ignore-removal | [--update | -u]]
		 [--intent-to-add | -N] [--refresh] [--ignore-errors] [--ignore-missing]
		 [--] [<pathspec>...]

DESCRIPTION
       This command updates the index using the current content found in the
       working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit. It
       typically adds the current content of existing paths as a whole, but
       with some options it can also be used to add content with only part of
       the changes made to the working tree files applied, or remove paths
       that do not exist in the working tree anymore.

       The "index" holds a snapshot of the content of the working tree, and it
:      is this snapshot that is taken as the contents of the next commit. Thus
       after making any changes to the working directory, and before running
       the commit command, you must use the add command to add any new or
       modified files to the index.

       This command can be performed multiple times before a commit. It only
       adds the content of the specified file(s) at the time the add command
       is run; if you want subsequent changes included in the next commit,
       then you must run git add again to add the new content to the index.

       The git status command can be used to obtain a summary of which files
       have changes that are staged for the next commit.

       The git add command will not add ignored files by default. If any
       ignored files were explicitly specified on the command line, git add
       will fail with a list of ignored files. Ignored files reached by
       directory recursion or filename globbing performed by Git (quote your
       globs before the shell) will be silently ignored. The git add command
       can be used to add ignored files with the -f (force) option.

       Please see git-commit(1) for alternative ways to add content to a
       commit.

OPTIONS
       <pathspec>...
	   Files to add content from. Fileglobs (e.g.  *.c) can be given to
	   add all matching files. Also a leading directory name (e.g.	dir to
	   add dir/file1 and dir/file2) can be given to update the index to
	   match the current state of the directory as a whole (e.g.
	   specifying dir will record not just a file dir/file1 modified in
	   the working tree, a file dir/file2 added to the working tree, but
	   also a file dir/file3 removed from the working tree. Note that
	   older versions of Git used to ignore removed files; use --no-all
	   option if you want to add modified or new files but ignore removed
	   ones.

       -n, --dry-run
	   Don't actually add the file(s), just show if they exist and/or will
	   be ignored.

       -v, --verbose
	   Be verbose.

       -f, --force
	   Allow adding otherwise ignored files.
