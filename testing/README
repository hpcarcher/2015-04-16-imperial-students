Python Ant Colony TSP Solver
-----------------------------

Uses Ant Colony Optimization to solve the TSP.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization_algorithms 

anttsp.py is the file to run.  It reads from citiesAndDistances.pickled, which is a pickled 2D array with this format:
CityName1  CityName2 ... CitNameN
0           23               34         
10           0               22
.
.
.

It is not necessary for the matrix to be symmetric i.e. the distance traveling from A to B need not be the distance from B to A  (if you have ever been to Italy and dealt with the mess of one-way streets you will understand how this applies).


python anttsp.py <cities> <city data file> <output file>

<cities> is the number of cities to visit.
<city data file> is the pickled data file containing the city names and distances 2D array
<output file> is where the best path will be written.


Modified to not use threading - found issues running in Python 2.7.8 & Mac OS X 10.9.5 which stopping the program from terminating due to a lock/condition release issue.

Note: To use the utilities in the util directory the python package: argparse needs to be installed in your Python environment.
